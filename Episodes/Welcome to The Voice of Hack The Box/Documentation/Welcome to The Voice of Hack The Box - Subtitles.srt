Welcome to The Voice of Hack The Box.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,200
My name is Sky, and I am your host.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,400
Have you ever heard of Hack The Box?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,760
Have you tried their academy modules?

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,040
Have you discovered that reading alone,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,080
however interesting and well-structured the modules may be,

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,280
is a little tough to chew on?

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,400
Well, boy, do I have some good news for you!

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,360
This channel is dedicated to narrating the written content of Hack The Box Academy's modules.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,200
For those of you who don't know,

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
Hack the Box is a cybersecurity training website

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,560
dedicated to a human-first approach to teaching cybersecurity with gamified learning

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,000
making the transition from the raw fundamentals to advanced hacking scenarios

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,600
as thorough and painless as possible.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,600
One of Hack The Box's many public branches is Hack The Box Academy.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,840
It is a technical, text-book style form of learning with many pages of content

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,680
packed full of important information in the bite-sized chunks known as modules.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,000
I should be clear immediately that I am not sponsored by Hack The Box to do this.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,840
I am, at the very least, making a personal learning tool available to the public.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,920
All content I narrate is viewable with a free plan Hack The Box account.

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,720
Join me as I take you on a learning adventure deep into Hack The Box Academy's catalogue

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,880
with expertly referenced, mercilessly timestamped, and guidingly casual commentary.

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,840
Welcome to The Voice of Hack The Box.
